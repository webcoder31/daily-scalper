## Decision

* Modular Architecture with SOLID Principles
      
## Rationale 

* Separating concerns into distinct modules (strategies, backtest, utils) improves maintainability
* Using abstract classes (BaseStrategy) enables easy extension with new strategy implementations
* Clear interfaces between components reduces coupling

## Implementation Details

* strategies/ module contains all trading strategy implementations
* backtest/ module encapsulates the backtesting engine
* utils/ module provides supporting functionality
* Abstract BaseStrategy class defines the interface for all strategies

*
      
## Decision

* Vectorized Backtesting with vectorbt
      
## Rationale 

* Performance: Vectorized operations are significantly faster than iterative approaches
* Consistency: Standardized calculations of performance metrics
* Reliability: Well-tested library reduces implementation errors

## Implementation Details

* BacktestEngine uses vectorbt's Portfolio class to run simulations
* Performance metrics calculated using vectorbt's stats methods
* Slippage and commission modeling included in backtest configuration

*
      
## Decision

* Data Caching System
      
## Rationale 

* Reduce redundant API calls to Yahoo Finance
* Improve application responsiveness
* Protect against API rate limits and network issues

## Implementation Details

* Data is stored in data/ directory
* Cache validity controlled by cache_max_age_hours parameter (default 24h)
* Automatic validation and refreshing of stale data

*
      
## Decision

* Rich Interactive Terminal UI
      
## Rationale 

* Improved user experience with formatted tables and color
* Clearer presentation of complex financial metrics
* Better error reporting and status indicators

## Implementation Details

* Uses rich library for terminal formatting
* Tables for presenting metrics and comparison results
* Panels for section headers and status messages
* Color coding for positive/negative performance indicators
*
      
## Decision

* Refactor Prompt Text Display to Avoid Duplicate Default Values
      
## Rationale 

* Current implementation shows default values twice:
  1. In the prompt text string with square brackets: `[BTC-USD]`
  2. Automatically by Rich's Prompt.ask() function with parentheses: `(BTC-USD)`
* This creates redundant UI like: `"Crypto pair [BTC-USD]: (BTC-USD):"`
* Cleaner UI would improve user experience

## Implementation Details

* Remove default values from prompt text strings in main.py
* Keep default values in the Prompt.ask() function parameters
* Document changes in memory-bank/prompt-refactoring.md
* This change maintains functionality while improving UI clarity

* Added `LoggingConfig` class with methods to configure logging application-wide
* Implemented `setup_application_logging()` function for easy command line integration
* Added command line argument parsing in `cli.py` with options:
  - `--verbose` / `-v`: Enable INFO level logging
  - `--log-level`: Set specific log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - `--log-file`: Save logs to file in addition to console
  - `--quiet` / `-q`: Disable all logging output
* Updated all modules to use centralized logging configuration:
  - `backtest/backtest_engine.py`
  - `backtest/performance_metrics.py`
  - `utils/data_loader.py`
  - `utils/period_translator.py`
  - `utils/strategy_saver.py`
  - `utils/theme.py`
  - `utils/ui_components.py`
  - `utils/visualizer.py`
  - `strategies/strategy_registry.py`
* Replaced individual `logging.basicConfig()` calls with centralized `get_logger()` function
* Default behavior: Only WARNING and ERROR messages are shown (minimal logging)
* Added `--file-only` option to log exclusively to file without console output
* Enhanced logging configuration with file_only parameter and proper validation
* Comprehensive testing confirms all logging levels work correctly including quiet mode and file-only logging


[2025-08-03 17:49:00] - Comprehensive Daily Scalper Refactoring Architecture Plan

## Decision

* Plan comprehensive refactoring of Daily Scalper project to achieve professional-level code quality through systematic reorganization of directory structure, class renaming, and module separation

## Rationale 

* Current codebase has grown organically and needs professional-level organization
* Directory structure needs better separation of concerns (data/ → cache/, new organized modules)
* Class names need semantic accuracy and professional naming conventions
* File structure needs proper module separation for maintainability
* Need systematic approach to maintain functionality during transition
* Comprehensive mapping required to ensure all imports and references are properly updated

## Implementation Details

* **Current Architecture Analysis**: 
  - Well-organized modular structure with strategies/, backtest/, utils/, core files
  - Recently refactored with professional Python standards, type annotations, custom exceptions
  - Comprehensive validation confirms 46/46 tests passing with no circular dependencies
  - 4 registered strategies (Bollinger Bands, EMA+RSI, RSI, SMA) with full functionality

* **Directory Structure Transformation**:
  - Rename 'data/' → 'cache/' for semantic accuracy
  - Create new organized structure: core/, strategies/, backtesting/, market_data/, visualization/, persistence/, ui/, utils/
  - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

* **Core Class Renaming Strategy**:
  - DailyScalper → TradingStrategyBacktester (main application controller)
  - DataLoader → MarketDataProvider (data fetching and caching)
  - Visualizer → BacktestChartBuilder (chart generation)
  - StrategySaver → StrategyResultsPersistence (results management)
  - BacktestEngine → StrategyBacktestEngine (backtesting execution)
  - PerformanceMetrics → PerformanceAnalyzer (metrics calculation)

* **Execution Strategy**:
  - Phase-based approach with dependency analysis

  - Comprehensive testing between phases
  - Rollback procedures for each step
  - Import dependency mapping and systematic updates

[2025-08-03 17:11:00] - **Phase 3 Class and Method Renaming Decisions**

## Strategic Naming Decisions

### Class Renaming Strategy
- **Decision**: Rename all core classes for professional semantic accuracy
- **Rationale**: Original names were too generic or didn't clearly indicate functionality
- **Impact**: Improved code readability and professional appearance

### Method Renaming Approach
- **Decision**: Use descriptive, action-oriented method names
- **Examples**: `backtest_strategy` → `execute_strategy_backtest`, `show_saved_strategies` → `display_saved_results`
- **Rationale**: Method names should clearly indicate what action they perform

### Variable Renaming Scope
- **Decision**: Rename only specific variables, keep standard financial terms
- **Kept Unchanged**: `symbol` and `period` (77 and 126 occurrences respectively)
- **Rationale**: These are standard, widely-accepted terms in financial/trading domain
- **Renamed**: `strategy_params` → `strategy_parameters`, `show_plots` → `display_charts`, `save_if_profitable` → `auto_save_profitable_results`

### Import Statement Management
- **Decision**: Update all import statements systematically
- **Approach**: File-by-file comprehensive update to prevent broken references
- **Result**: Maintained all external library compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Comprehensive functional testing after each major change
- **Approach**: Fix functional test imports and method calls to match new names
- **Validation**: Ensure complete backtest execution with all features working

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Method Reference Updates
- **Challenge**: Ensuring all internal method calls use new names
- **Solution**: Systematic search and replace across entire codebase
- **Verification**: Functional test execution to catch any missed references

### Backward Compatibility
- **Decision**: Complete migration without backward compatibility
- **Rationale**: Clean break for professional naming, no legacy method support needed
- **Impact**: All code now uses consistent, professional naming conventions

### Error Handling
- **Approach**: Maintain all existing error handling while updating method names
- **Result**: No loss of functionality or error reporting capabilities


[2025-08-03 19:59:00] - **User Post-Refactoring Corrections and Completions**
